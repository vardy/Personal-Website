# My personal website

## Todo

 - Copy-to-clipboard button for code blocks on-hover
 - Chain buttons to link to headers on-hover
 - Posts directory
 - Posts auto-indexing with meta-data added to app.js posts object
 - Get most recent posts using github downloader from seperate repo so that pushing new blog posts doesn't trigger CI. Use a webhook to listen for new changes to that repo and download on change. (https://github.com/Decad/github-downloader)
 - CI/CD
